### Websites ###

#### Songza.com ####
My main squeeze for the past couple of years. The development team (i.e. people actually writing code) has varied from 2 to 4 people over time. Some of my major contributions include writing the REST API (twice; once in PHP, then again in Python), most of the mongoengine models, the authentication system, and a comprehensive test suite. Plus whatever else needed to be done. http://songza.com

#### Legal Ipsum ####
A silly little toy I threw together on a lark.  For those times when you need some legal-sounding gibberish but don't have the budget to hire a lawyer at $400/hr.  A good example of an MVP, for extremely small values of M.  http://legalipsum.com

#### Harlem Yacht Club ####
A small website I maintain for the Harlem Yacht Club, of which I am a member.  Nothing terribliy exciting here.  A mostly static collection of pages built with django-cms.  In case it wasn't obvious from this site, graphic design is not my strong point.  The only thing more dangerous than a software guy with a screwdriver is a back-end server guy doing layout and writing CSS.  http://hyc.org

### Recent presentations and events ###

#### Lessons from running a web site.  A short talk in two acts ####
The New York Python Meetup Group, November 15, 2011.  Tech talk describing two bits of tooling developed in support of songza.com.  One tool provides tracking of a given HTTP request as it traverses multiple layers of proxies and spawns additional queries on back end services.  The second tool gives an easy way to manage and discover HTTP services in a multi-process server cluster.  Slides attached.
