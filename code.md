### Open source code ###
My life has been enhanced by open source software in more ways than I can count.  In an attempt to give back to the community, I maintain a small repository of software I have written and open sourced.  In many cases, the code was originally written for my employer (S7 Labs) or our clients, and they have generously agreed to open source it.

The repository is maintained at https://bitbucket.org/roysmith/python-tools.  If you find any problems, drop me an email (roy@panix.com), or open an issue in the tracker (https://bitbucket.org/roysmith/python-tools/issues).
