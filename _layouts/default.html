	  <p>Allow me to introduce myself. I am Roy Smith, sole
	  proprietor of City Island Software.  I write software for a
	  living, and have been doing so for a long time. Near as I
	  can recollect, I've been writing software since 1975, and
	  have been getting paid to write it since 1980.</p>

	  <p>City Island Software is the next best thing to a virtual
	  company. It is a noncorporeal company, which is to say it
	  doesn't exist. But, if you're willing to overlook such minor
	  isuses, it's actually a pretty nice place to work.  Benefits
	  range from a 20 10 30 Mbps internet connection to being able
	  sit on my front porch and write code in my bare feet, a one
	  minute walk from Long Island Sound. In addition to the
	  proprietor, City Island Software employs two domesticated
	  felines, named Tribble and Yoda. Their precise roles are
	  confidential.</p>
