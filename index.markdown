Allow me to introduce myself. I am Roy Smith, sole
proprietor of City Island Software.  I write software for a
living, and have been doing so for a long time. Near as I
can recollect, I've been writing software since 1975, and
have been getting paid to write it since 1980.

City Island Software is the next best thing to a virtual
company. It is a noncorporeal company, which is to say it
doesn't exist. But, if you're willing to overlook such minor
isuses, it's actually a pretty nice place to work.  Benefits
range from a 20 10 30 Mbps internet connection to being able
sit on my front porch and write code in my bare feet, a one
minute walk from Long Island Sound. In addition to the
proprietor, City Island Software employs two domesticated
felines, named Tribble and Yoda. Their precise roles are
confidential.
